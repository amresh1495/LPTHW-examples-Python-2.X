![]({{site.baseurl}}//ex17.PNG)This repository contains some examples from the book "Learn Python The Hard Way - Zed A. Shaw".
All examples have been tested for output.
I have attempted to explain the complex parts of a python program through comments in these examples.
Only some examples which are really important for beginners have been written.
